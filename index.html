            <h4>DC- DC CONVERTER</h4>
            <p>As the team leader for an Electronics Engineering project, I was tasked with creating a converter from scratch.
                Collaborating with my team, we designed and assembled the printed circuit board (PCB), sourced the necessary
                materials, and utilized 3D printing technology to produce a functional prototype. Throughout the project, I
                oversaw every aspect of the process, from the initial design phase to the final assembly and testing. I closely
                worked with team members to ensure clarity on their responsibilities and that we met our project milestones on
                time.</p>

                <p> <br> Technologies: Meta Spark, Blender, and JavaScript. <br>
                   <br> In my role as the team leader for our graduation project, I supervised the design and development of a unique
                    and innovative Clock that could be utilized in both the physical and virtual worlds. Leveraging AR technology and
                    coding with Arduino, we successfully created a functional clock that could be accessed and interacted with in
                    various settings. <br>
                    The project presented numerous challenges, including mastering new programming languages and technologies,
                    and ensuring that our design was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. As the team leader, I managed our
                    project timeline, delegated tasks, and communicated effectively with team members to ensure that we met our
                    goals.</p>

                        <br>Features: I created a simple game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. As someone who is always looking to improve,
                        I took a JavaScript course to enhance my skills while searching for a job after graduation. As a result, I designed a

                        This project allowed me to put my newly acquired knowledge into practice and provided me with valuable experience in game development. I'm excited to
